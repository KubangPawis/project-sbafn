# Project SBAFN (Street-based Assessment for Flood-prone Neighborhoods)

## üìñ Overview

Project SBAFN is an explainable, **street-level flood-proneness** visualization and decision-support app for Philippine cities. It visually communicates per-street, evidence-backed flood insights that planners can act on.

> This project aims to supersede **Project NOAH**, the Philippines' state-of-the-art initiative that provides area-based hazard overview, highlighting flood hazard zones at the national level. SBAFN offers the next step by covering the existing gaps of NOAH, by showing the street-level specifics of why floods happen, and give the explainability that was long needed for actual, effective decision making.

## üîé What SBAFN Adds

- **Street-segment granularity:** scores every road segment (green/yellow/red) instead of broad barangay/city polygons.
- **Explainability panel:** shows *why* a specific street scores that way. It includes insights about:
  - Physical indicators (e.g., drainage grates, curb inlets, proximity to canals)
  - Topography (e.g., elevation, relative elevation, slope)
  - Road Data (e.g., width/class/intersections)
- **Scenario + Prioritization:** stress-test each street segment based on previous reported rainfall events (25/50/100 mm/hr rain).
- **Actionable outputs:** export GeoJSON/CSV for LGU planning, work orders, and DRRM briefings.

#### B. Setup

The following indicates a quick step-by-step to run the project using **Windows PowerShell**.

```bat
REM 1) Clone the repo (pick one)
git clone git@github.com:KubangPawis/project-sbafn.git
git clone https://github.com/KubangPawis/project-sbafn.git

REM 2) Go into the project folder
cd /d C:\path\to\project-sbafn
```

**Run the app (Flutter web):**

``` bat
REM 1.) Navigate to the Flutter app directory
cd sbafn_app

REM 2.) Run the app
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=MAPTILER_KEY=<INSERT_API_KEY>
```

**(Optional) Rebuild data pipeline**
Warning: large downloads; can take 24h+ on first run.

``` bat
REM 1) Create and activate a venv
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

REM 2) Install Python dependencies
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

REM 3) Run pipeline
python -m pipeline.core
```

> Note: Large third-party data (e.g., Mapillary imagery) is not stored in this repo due to licensing and size. Use the provided scripts to fetch and prepare data, or download precomputed artifacts from the Releases page.

## üéØ Methodology

![Project SBAFN's Methodology Diagram](docs/images/methods_diagram.png)

### A. üåä Flood-Proneness Indicators

Project SBAFN employs a hybrid geo implementation, employing both raster and vector geodata. Specifically through the following metrics:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature Type</th>
            <th>Indicator Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <body>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="6">Physical Indicators</td>
            <td>Curb Inlets</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Drainage Grates</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vegetation Strips</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Open Canals</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Curb Height (to add)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Driveway Gaps (to add)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">Topographic Data</td>
            <td>Absolute Elevation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Relative Elevation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Road Slope</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Geospatial Data</td>
            <td>Road Classification</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Road Width</td>
        </tr>
    </body>
</table>

## ü§ñ Models

### Street-View Indicators: Object Detection

* **Model**: YOLOv11
* **Data:** Manila street-view corpus (**330k+** images); trained on a labeled subset for v1.0

### Flood-Proneness Scoring: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Model

* **Model**: LightGBM
* **Inputs:** Physical indicators, topography, road network, rainfall/reports
* **Output:** calibrated flood-proneness probability score [0, 1]

‚û°Ô∏è Full model detailings: see [`docs/MODELS.md`](docs/MODELS.md)
