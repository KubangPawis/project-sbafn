# Project SBAFN: *Street-based Assessment for Flood-prone Neighborhoods*

### 📖 Overview

[Project SBAFN](https://project-sbafn.vercel.app) is an explainable, street-level flood-proneness visualization and decision-support app for Philippine cities. It visually communicates per-street, evidence-backed flood insights that planners can act on.

> [!NOTE]
> This project aims to supersede **Project NOAH**, the Philippines' state-of-the-art initiative that provides area-based hazard overview, highlighting flood hazard zones at the national level. SBAFN offers the next step by covering the existing gaps of NOAH, by showing the street-level specifics of why floods happen, and give the explainability that was long needed for actual, effective decision making.

### What Project SBAFN Adds

- **Street-Level Granularity -** scores every road segment (green/yellow/red) instead of broad barangay/city polygons.
- **Explainability -** shows *why* a specific street scores that way. It includes insights about street-level physical flood proneness indicators, topography data, road data, all mapped to historical flood events as basis.
- **Scenario + Prioritization -** stress-test each street segment based on previous reported rainfall events (30/50/100 mm/hr rain).
- **Actionable Insights -** Upon full release of Project SBAFN, outputs can be used for LGU planning, work orders, and DRRM briefings.

### 🧑‍💻 Install Locally

#### Prerequisites

To setup this project locally, ensure you have:

| Requirement   | Version                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Python        | 3.11+                                                 |
| Git           | 2.30+                                                 |
| Flutter       | 3.35+                                                 |

#### Setup

The following indicates a quick step-by-step to run the project using **Windows PowerShell**.

```bat
REM 1) Clone the repo (pick one)
git clone git@github.com:KubangPawis/project-sbafn.git
git clone https://github.com/KubangPawis/project-sbafn.git

REM 2) Go into the project folder
cd /d C:\path\to\project-sbafn
```

**Run the app (Flutter web):**

``` bat
REM 1.) Navigate to the Flutter app directory
cd sbafn_app

REM 2.) Run the app
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=MAPTILER_KEY=<INSERT_API_KEY>
```

**(Optional) Rebuild data pipeline**

To rebuild the data pipeline, follow the set of steps listed below. Large third-party data (e.g., Mapillary imagery) is not stored in this repo due to licensing and size. Use the provided scripts to fetch and prepare data.

``` bat
REM 1) Create and activate a venv
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

REM 2) Install Python dependencies
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

REM 3) Run pipeline
python -m pipeline.core
```

> [!WARNING]
> Rebuilding the pipeline require large downloads. Downloading all raw feature files can take about **≈24+ hours** to complete. Instead, a pre-built features dataset was used to supply the model for the prediction.

## 🎯 Methodology

![Project SBAFN's Methodology Diagram](docs/images/methods_diagram.png)

#### 🌊 Flood-Proneness Indicators

Project SBAFN employs a hybrid geo implementation, employing both raster and vector geodata. Specifically through the following metrics:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature Type</th>
            <th>Indicator Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <body>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="6">Physical Indicators</td>
            <td>Curb Inlets</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Drainage Grates</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vegetation Strips</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Open Canals</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Curb Height (to add)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Driveway Gaps (to add)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">Topographic Data</td>
            <td>Absolute Elevation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Relative Elevation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Road Slope</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Geospatial Data</td>
            <td>Road Classification</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Road Width</td>
        </tr>
    </body>
</table>

* **Output:** Physical indicator count per street segment

### Flood-Proneness Scoring: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Model

* **Model**: LightGBM

* **Output:** calibrated flood-proneness probability score [0, 1]

➡️ Full model detailings: see [`docs/MODELS.md`](docs/MODELS.md)

> **Disclaimer (Pilot):** Scores are model-derived estimates and may be inaccurate. **Not for emergency use**—verify with LGU/DRRM advisories.

- Scale beyond Manila → Metro Manila → nationwide
- Context-based Story Map generation
